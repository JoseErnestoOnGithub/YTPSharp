## YTP# is a modified version of YTP++, that includes more features and more plugins.
### The list includes the following:

* More plugins
* Website
* More new features

## A warning call
For those of you using plugins, please be aware that YTP# has no mind in what is a real plugin batch and what isn't. Any non-verified plugins have the potential to be malicious, be on the lookout for the malicious use of plugins as there is a possibility that a plugin can be harmful. Remember to **NEVER** start YTP# as an administrator.

## What is YTP+, YTP++ and YTP#?
YTP+ is the name given to a set of tools to automatically generate YouTube Poop videos.
YTP++ is the name given to the second iteration of the software, however there was once a [YTP++ made in Electron and Node.JS](https://github.com/TeamPopplio/ytpplus-node-ui).
YTP# is a modified version of YTP++ that includes more features and more plugins, which helps you into making YTPs very well.

## How do I configure YTP#?
All configuration settings may be found in the application itself, either on the interface or in the Tools menu. [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org) is required for the Squidward effect but is otherwise not needed.
A 32-bit version of [VLC](http://videolan.org/vlc) is recommended to run this software, please install it beforehand for enhanced functionality.

## I had trouble running YTP#, it just crashes!
Try installing the [.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472) or newer runtime. Please note that YTP# does not currently run on Windows Vista or below and has only been tested under Windows 10, thus requiring Windows 7 or later.

## I installed VLC, but it's still giving me an error?
Please make sure it is the **32-bit** version of VLC. The **64-bit** version will not work for this program.

## Why is Weird not working, despite having ImageMagick installed and configured?
Try adding magick.exe to your system path. If you've checked the box needed in the installation prompt for ImageMagick, try restarting your computer. If all else fails, try setting magick.exe manually via the Tools menu.

## I have a great idea for the program, where to start?
You can use the Git CLI to make pull requests, or GitHub if you want to do this on the web.
